  The response body contains the status of the specified asynchronous operation, indicating whether it has succeeded, is in progress, or has failed.

If the asynchronous operation succeeded, the response body includes the HTTP status code for the successful request. If the asynchronous operation failed, the response body includes the HTTP status code for the failed request and error information regarding the failure.
